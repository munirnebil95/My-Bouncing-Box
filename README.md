# my_bouncing_box
•	Tech stack: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Description

•	Created the classic windows screen saver that has a box continuously bouncing has it reaches the corner of the screen

•	We defined the (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) at the very top left of the screen

• The box must move diagonally and each time it reaches a border it will change direction of the border it touched.

• If the box is moving bottom-right:

-- when it reaches the bottom border it will go top.

-- when it reaches the right border it will go left.

• Speed rate between 0.3 and 1 second seems to be good values.
